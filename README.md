## Issue Ticketing and Branch Names
Anyone can make tickets whether they are for bugs found or miletstones that need to be reached. They should each have a title and a description which includes the objective the ticket wishes to achieve. Branch names that correspond to tickets should be titled 'fundfest-x.y' where x is the ticket number and y is any subdivision of the ticket. Subdivisions could entail code revisions, partial ticket fulfillment, etc. This point of this is really just to easily map a branch back to a ticket.

## VC Management
In order to lower merge conflicts, every feature/ticket will require a feature branch to be made. The owner of the branch will complete the ticket's requirements on that branch, and when finished, will make a pull request to the master branch. On order to become 1334 Android Haxorz, at least one code review should take place (unless otherwise agreed upon). During the code review, the reviewer will give possible suggestions for aesthetic or functional code changes as well as test for possible app-breaking errors. Once passed, the review has passed, the branch may be merged.
