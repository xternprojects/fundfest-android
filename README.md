## VC Management
In order to lower merge conflicts, every feature/ticket will require a feature branch to be made. The owner of the branch will complete the ticket's requirements on that branch, and when finished, will make a pull request to the master branch. On order to become 1334 Android Haxorz, at least one code review should take place (unless otherwise agreed upon). During the code review, the reviewer will give possible suggestions for aesthetic or functional code changes as well as test for possible app-breaking errors. Once passed, the review has passed, the branch may be merged.
